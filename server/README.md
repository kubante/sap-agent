��# How to Add New Services

To add a new service (e.g., "stocks"), you would only need to:

1. Create a new service class implementing `DataService`
2. Register it in the service registry
3. Update the Job interface to include the new type

The `executeJob` function will automatically work with the new service without any modifications!

The system now supports both weather and country jobs seamlessly, and you can easily extend it to support any number of additional services.
